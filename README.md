Do you want to get that high paying job as a developer without having to send 150 applications? Without working for free or doing yet another Bootcamp? 

Tired of not having "enough experience"? Of machine-generated rejections to job applications that took you hours to complete? Of freezing in tech interviews? 

My name is Dragos.

And this is my mission. To help you get that high paying programming job you are dreaming of. To allow you to live comfortably for the rest of your dev career. 

The catch? I've done it all before.

When my consulting company went bankrupt, I've built a career in the software industry and ended up joining one of Europe's top tech companies.

I help you: 

a) Gain confidence in your skills with a clear leaning plan and pair programming sessions

b) Stand out in coding interviews by reasoning like a seasoned engineer

c) Get the best offers in the market by learning how to sell yourself as a developer to


I've "been there and done that" and I believe that with the right mindset and guidance, anyone can get a job in tech. 🚀
