The latest JS framework won't get you hired.\
\
OOP and prototypal inheritance won't get you hired.\
\
Functional programming won't get you hired.\
\
A clear thinking process will do.\
\
Teamwork will do.\
\
Active listening skills will do.\
\
Honesty about what you know will do.\
\
Willingness to learn will do.\
\
In software development*, the ability to do the job doesn't mean job fit.\
\
Work hard, be kind.\
\
Help everyone you come in touch with.\
\
That will get you hired.
