Don't leave any money on the table.

Worst negotiation advice ever.

Most money is never on the table.👇🏼

Growth potential, mentorship schemes with C-levels, contribution impact, and development into leadership roles, are usually not on the table.

So, my dear developer, my younger self.

Next time you negotiate,

make yourself a favour.

And take a look under.

What's the last thing you left "under the table"? 

Stay cool,

Dragos

P.S. I forgot "never give the first number" and "whatever", but hey I am no expert, just a software dev.[](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6671285627062890496&keywords=%23careeradvice&originTrackingId=JE6I4A%2BGQHC6273%2FDFUyCQ%3D%3D)
