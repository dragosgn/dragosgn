What you are afraid to put on GitHub,\
\
they probably have in production*. ðŸ˜‚\
\
Look, you have to start somewhere.\
\
When in doubt,\
make your code public.\
\
It will raise your standards.\
\
It will show your "dedication to improvement".\
\
It will make you confident in what you know.\
\
And, feel free to look at my GitHub. ðŸ™ˆ\
\
Good luck finding 'perfect' code there.\
\

\
Stay cool,\
Dragos\

P.S. As developers, we do our best to ship functional, clean, bug-free code.\
Yet time constraints, fuzzy requirements, and all kinds of factors contribute to exactly the opposite.
