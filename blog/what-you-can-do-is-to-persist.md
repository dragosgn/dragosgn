"They are kicking my \*\** for being a poor leader. How can I learn faster?"

You can't.

Learning takes time, particularly in leadership. 

What you can do is to persist. 

Keep making it happen. 

Persistence alone inspires others. Trust me; you will earn their respect.

And that's the first step to lead.
