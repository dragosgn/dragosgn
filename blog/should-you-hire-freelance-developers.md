You don't want to hire freelance developers.

Because their knowledge disappears when they leave?

Sometimes, they are your best asset. ðŸš€

I might be biased.

I had a really positive experience with senior JS devs early in my career.

They speeded up the project.

They skilled team members and brought outside knowledge.

They helped us with architectural choices and documentation.

They improved our code standards.

Their knowledge stayed with us long after they were gone.

So, when in doubt.

Hire freelancers.



Stay cool,

Dragos
