"I have 12 years of experience in the industry." - (age 27)

Really? I don't buy it. ðŸ™ƒ

This kind of statement still intimidates me.

And I have a background in Engineering and a few years of experience already.

I understand you want to give a feeling of how "much" you know.

Yet, be mindful.

There are other people in the room.

Not everyone had the privilege of such early exposure to technology.

They might be Bootcamp graduates or self-taught.

And for the record.

I was playing computer games and procrastinating when I was 11.

It was a hell of a childhood.

Still gaming.

And still kicking it in software though :)



Stay cool,
