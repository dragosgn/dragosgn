Are you nervous?

So you hang up when the interview is over.

Sorry, but you are missing out.

That's when the magic happens.

Are you ready?

That's when "Hey a bit of feedback on my code?" comes in.

You can even be pushy here.

Follow up.

What would they do better?

Was it the algorithm?

Was testing?

They will probably help you out.

Offer or not offer, time was worth it.

Now that you know it,

you can do something about it.

So, next time.

Make yourself a favor.

Don't hang up.

Stay cool,

Dragos
