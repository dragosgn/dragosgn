If you were to recommend.\
\
One single book to level up my JavaScript skills.\
\
What would that be?\
\
Easy.\
\
You want something to teach you the foundations.\
\
The ins and outs.\
\
So when you get to the interview.\
\
Closures, callbacks, scope, and async will be a piece of cake.\
\
Then: "You don't know JS" by [Kyle Simpson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAGX18cB4cyeQm1Jd8hPozrQ8YFvIyF3UOg) is perfect.\
\
I've read the series soon in my dev career.\
\
Still checking it occasionally.\
\
Cake anyone?\
\
<br />\
\
Stay cool,\
Dragos
