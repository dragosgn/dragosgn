\
Struggling to get your foot in the door?\
\
Forget about CVs and applications for a moment.\
\
ðŸ’¡ Start small: go for startups.\
\
They are willing to take risks and hire 'underdogs'.\
\
ðŸ’¡ Be genuine: don't apply, build relationships.\
\
Follow their CTOs here and on Twitter.\
\
What technology do they use? Why?\
\
ðŸ’¡ Get involved: study their GitHub.\
\
They usually have some piece of open source.\
\
Help out with open issues.\
\
With documentation and reporting.\
\
Stand out.\
\
It is not about being better, it is about being different.\
\
When was the last time you 'stood out'?

Stay cool,\
