title: On teaching - Part I
---
Last September, I joined the ESMT Coding Bootcamp as a Teaching Assistant. My role consists of supporting the students on their full-stack learning journey. I do this after the instructor introduces the material for the session, either during class or through one to one personalised sessions.

The experience has been one of the most rewarding in my professional career. Supporting individuals on their learning journey offers you a unique perspective on people and helps you become a more empathetic leader.

As software engineers, we operate in abstract worlds. We are trained to translate real-world problems into something that a machine can understand and execute. It is within that process of navigating abstractions that the "real" impact of your work gets sometimes distorted.

Teaching is nothing like that. Receiving thank you emails at midnight from a student that, with your support, has finally managed to solve that hard bug is priceless and goes far beyond financial compensation or career advancement.

Our students are a very diverse crowd. We have 10+ nationalities, different ages, genders, and goals. But they all share a common trait; they are determined, ambitious, and eager to build a career in tech. It was their motivation that kept me on track many times.

Like any human relationship, empathy and understanding are the keys to success. First, you must understand what they are struggling with, how do they feel, and what is their approach to solving the issue. Then you can give advice, even correcting direction or use a Socratic dialogue in the quest to find a solution.

Handling two jobs might be a bit exhausting; you will have to sacrifice personal time and feel a bit exhausted at times. The experience is worth every minute of it. So start right now. If you don't have the opportunity to do it within a class format, try to help somebody that's at the beginning of their learning curve. For those interested in growing into the leadership direction, teaching is a perfect fist step.
