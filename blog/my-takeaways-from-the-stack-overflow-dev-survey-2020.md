title: My takeaways from the Stack Overflow Dev Survey 2020

Stack Overflow Dev Survey 2020 is here.

My key takeaways. ðŸ“š

JavaScript is the most used programming language.

Typescript gains momentum.

jQuery is still king, yet losing ground to React.js.

More than half of the developers use Node.js.

Gatsby is coming strong this year.

As for me, it is still JavaScript, Typescript, and React.

Together with the beautiful VS Code.

And I still love my Mac.

What about you?



Stay cool,

Dragos
