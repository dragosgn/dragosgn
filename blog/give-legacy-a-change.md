"I am only dealing with legacy code at my job.

I can't use the latest frameworks."

Give "legacy" a chance. ðŸ¤“

That code boils down decades of experience.

Design patterns, data structures, and clean code principles are probably there.

Those programming fundamentals will serve you well throughout your career.

Make the most of that "legacy".

And about the latest stuff.

That will also be legacy one day ([](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6675639412115689472&keywords=%23react&originTrackingId=SLzk8FI2wnph6VZt2SX0Zg%3D%3D)react ðŸ‘€).

Give "legacy" a chance,

you won't regret it.

Stay cool,

Dragos
