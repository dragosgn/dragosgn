"I started a company because corporate is full of id\*\*\*\*s" is pure BS.

Corporate job = stable cashflow.

Stable cashflow = capital and mental space for learning and long-term risk-taking.

And all the great relationships and experiences you get in between. ðŸ¥°

So, unless you have a "special" opportunity on the line.

Get a corporate job.

Stay cool, Dragos

P.S. What is a "special" opportunity? That's for another post. ðŸš€
