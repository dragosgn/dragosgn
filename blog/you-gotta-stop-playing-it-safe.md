title: You gotta stop playing it safe.
description: Software is a competitive industry.
---
If you are a Bootcamp grad.\
\
Wanting a high paying programming job.\
\
You gotta stop playing it safe.\
\
Software is a competitive industry.\
\
And a post-pandemic economy made it even harder.\
\
I hate the phrase.\
\
But it is time to 'hustle'.\
\
Time to track, mechanize, and scale your effort (think Excel).\
\
Time to reach out to places that are not hiring.\
\
Time to re-think your "positioning".\
\
Time to keep persisting.\
\
Time to oversell.\
\
You will figure out the "game" and get what you want.\
\
But right now.\
\
It is time to risk it.\
\
\
\
Stay cool,\
Dragos
