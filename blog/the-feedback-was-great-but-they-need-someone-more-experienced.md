The feedback was great.\
\
They loved your code.\
\
But, they need someone more experienced.\
\
Tough.\
\
What happened?\
\
For a manager with 30 years in software,\
\
a three months Bootcamp doesn't cut it.\
\
You lack certifications.\
\
And experience.\
\
My two cents?

1. Avoid companies that care about certifications.
2. Get involved in bigger projects.

\
And do it now.\
\
Don't blame companies.\
Don't blame recruiters.\
Don't blame yourself.\
\
Just code.\
\
\
\
Stay cool,\
Dragos
