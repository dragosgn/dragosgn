Use this to keep going:\
\
âœ…  A requirement is not clear â‡’ ask for clarifications.\
\
âœ…  You don't know something â‡’ just say it and follow up.\
\
âœ… Got stuck â‡’ ask the interviewer for support.\
\
âœ… When nervous â‡’ pause and breathe.\
\
âœ… Talking to yourself â‡’ make the interviewer part of the solution.\
\
Show me how you reason about code.\
\
Talk about the pros and cons.\
\
Analyze tradeoffs.\
\
And bring your best smile. ðŸ˜Š\
\
Is getting awkward with all these Zoom calls anyways.

\
Stay cool,\
