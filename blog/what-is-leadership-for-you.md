Times have changed.\
\
Wisdom in these words still applies. 🦉\
\
“Leadership is not magnetic personality, that can just as well be a glib tongue.\
\
It is not "making friends and influencing people", that is flattery.\
\
Leadership is lifting a person's vision to higher sights, the raising of a person's performance to a higher standard, the building of a personality beyond its normal limitations.”\
\
More than 35 years ago, Peter Drucker tried to define leadership.\
\
Thinking back of leaders I admire.\
\
My "heroes" had different goals, styles, genders, and races.\
\
Yet, one thing in common.\
\
Their ability to inspire. 🌟\
\
To build people up and bring them together.\
\
What is leadership for you?
