title: On Titles and Salaries
description: 'Until then, behave like the professional you truly are.'
---
A lot of talk regarding titles and salary in software right now.



Look, a senior is a senior, no matter what. She/he doesn't wait for a promotion to do the right thing. To behave the right way.

Professionally, attitude and living up to certain standards make you a Senior.

Yes, compensation and titles should reflect contribution. It doesn't always happen. Sometimes the timing is not right or the budget is not there.



And sometimes, you can't change that "sometimes".

What you can do is live up to your reputation.

You will be noticed.

Until then, behave like the professional you are.





Stay cool,

Dragos
