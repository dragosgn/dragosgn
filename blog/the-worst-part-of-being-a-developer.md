The worst part of being a developer.\
\
It is not the bugs.\
\
It is not the long nights.\
\
It is not staring at a screen for days.\
\
It is not the countless articles, the untold pressure, the constant effort.\
\
It is fear.\
\
Fear of not having what it takes.\
\
Fear of not being on the latest sh\*\*t out there.\
\
Fear on not having written enough unit tests, not having enough cloud knowledge and not having checked the latest newsletter.\
\
You were trained to be extremely deterministic.\
\
In a world full of randomness.\
\
Well, I have a secret.\
\
That fear will never go away.\
\
And when it does.\
\
I bet you will miss it.\
\
\
\
Stay cool,\
Dragos
