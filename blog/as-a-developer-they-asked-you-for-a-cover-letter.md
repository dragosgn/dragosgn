No matter how desperate you are for a job.\
\
Make your self a service. 🤞🏽\
\
And don't waste your time.\
\
Your GitHub is your cover letter.\
\
Your Blog is your cover letter.\
\
Your LinkedIn is your cover letter.\
\
It is probably not the kind of company you want to work for.\
\
Who owns a printer these days anyway?\
\
Save the planet,\
screw the cover letter. 🌍\
\
\
\
Stay cool,\
Dragos
