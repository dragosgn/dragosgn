## 1. Technical Expertise: go beyond languages and frameworks

A solid understanding of programming fundamentals will serve you well into your career. That means familiarity with data structures, popular algorithms and design patterns. This is particularly critical for self-taught software developers.

With each task and project, you will develop a "feeling" of what code performs best. How design patterns make your life easier. Where you can cut corners, and where you can't.

In your first job, you probably start with one framework and project. As soon as you become an expert in that, put active effort into becoming more and more technology agnostic.

If you are a front-end developer, build a few "full-stack" projects. If you are a backend developer, make a small piece of UI. Observe the possibilities of different languages, frameworks, and cloud technologies. Extrapolate what you have learned to your current stack and vice versa.

To accelerate this learning, I recommend classics such as The Pragmatic Programmer and Clean Code. They will teach you about code hygiene, things like KISS, DRY, and how to write clean efficient code .

Having a series of tools in your mental kit will help you be more creative when facing technical challenges. It will help you think a few steps ahead when designing solutions and be more pragmatic.

No time to do this?

**Advice:** negotiate a learning budget\*\*. A\*\*pproach your manager and propose them that every Friday, you will use some hours to learn something new. It can be theoretic aspects of software development or a different technology.

## 2. Communication: leave "awkwardness" at the door:

Communication is often underrated in software engineering. Probably due to the long-lasting cliche of programmers being "awkward and grumpy" .

Half of your job is to communicate what you do. You will participate in grooming sessions, planning sessions, demo meetings, pair programming and mobbing, retrospectives ... etc. You will do this in writing or verbally.

Whether it is a piece of code, feature or a team issue, with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Your success is tied directly to your ability to communicate.

Communicating technical solutions, measuring pros and cons and without losing your audience is hard. It means knowing how to disagree, how to receive feedback and how to give feedback back. Knowing how to listen actively, to your manager, to the product owner, or to a fellow developer.

Is communication a "soft" skill? I used to believe that, now I have to disagree. Communication is hard, don't take it for granted.

**Advice:** use every opportunity you get to present and speak in public. Help writing stories, READMEs, documenting code and technical decisions. And why not, put some of those learnings in a blog article.

## 3. Teamwork: work "with" rather than "besides"

Given the high degree of specialisation in software, most projects need a team to succeed. Only if your team succeeds, you succeed. If your team fails, you fail. In software, lone-wolfs don't make it through the winter.

Most likely, your team will consist of diverse individuals with different goals and contexts. Focus on understanding other people's backgrounds, expectations, and communication styles and the ability to adapt to them and integrate yourself into the team. Helping others is the key to success.

Ask yourself: how can I enable my team members? What do they expect from me? What are their goals?

There is something interesting and unique about everyone in your team. Find out what it is, be genius. Give merit where is due, and when things go wrong, take one for the team. You are not perfect, and you can't expect others to be so.

Teamwork is about trust, empathy, and alignment. Learn how individuals can enable each other, working together and not "with" to deliver on a higher level. There is a lot of literature on the topic (5 Dysfunctions of a team).

I must admit it. It took me a while to understand that there is no I in team.

Advice: make connection with team members and coworkers. Get to know people in your team at a personal level. A simple way to do that is to have lunch with them from time to time. 

## 4. Network: who knows about you

Network means people that know about you, people that trust you. After working so hard on improving your skills, on doing a great job and helping others, it would be a pity not to give visibility to all the hard work.

Developers are awkward, and "networking" in the traditional way is drowning. Yet, give it a shot. The best opportunities I've got came through my network. And not only that.

Advice on new technology, recommendations, life long mentors and job opportunities all are easier to get through your network. Your network is your platform for change.

Start helping others out, and good things will happen.

You can also do that by trying to have lunch every week with someone you admire. In COVID-19 times, it is easier than ever as everyone is willing to help, and distance is no longer a barrier.

Advice: start creating connections now. Connect with like-minded developers that care about their professional image. Always, give more than you take.

## 5. Balance: consistency over time

I've been struggling to find balance ever since starting, and I've burned out more than once.

As a developer, It is so easy to just throw yourself at things, where is finishing a project or learning a new technology, or even writing an article. Unwatched stress accumulates, and it damages both your career and personal life.

Exercise, nutrition, and a well-deserved break from time to time will keep you going in the long run.

Advice: start creating connections now. Connect with like-minded developers that care about their professional image. Always, give more than you take.

### Closing up

Success in software is a mindset and a habit. Curiosity, continuous learning, and a passion for discovery are your fuel in such a fast-paced industry. Develop great habits, be kind and help everyone you come it touch with.
