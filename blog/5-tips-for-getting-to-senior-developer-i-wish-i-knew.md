Are you feeling "stuck"?

You want to level up as a developer. But, you don't know how. 

In software, there are no shortcuts. Success takes dedication and hard work. 

In your quest of getting to the next level, use these 5 tips to guide your effort:

## 1. Go beyond languages and frameworks

A solid understanding of programming will serve you well into your career. You must become familiar with data structures, popular algorithms, and design patterns. 

Learning the fundamentals is particularly critical for self-taught software developers who didn't have the chance to study them formally.

With each project you will naturally develop a "feeling" of what code performs best. Where you can cut corners and where you can't. A bit of extra effort on top of that and you will become a high-performer. 

At your first job, you will probably start with one framework and project. Become an expert in that specific area, learn the ins and outs. Then, make an effort to become more and more technology agnostic.

For example, if you are a front-end developer, build some "full-stack" projects. If you are a backend developer, make a small piece of UI. Explore the possibilities of different languages, frameworks and technologies.

I recommend reading classics such as The Pragmatic Programmer and Clean Code. They will teach you about code hygiene, things like KISS, DRY, and how to write clean, efficient programs.

**Pro tip**: negotiate a learning "Friday". Approach your manager and propose that every Friday, you will use some hours to learn something new. It can be a theoretical aspect of software development or different technology. They will most likely say yes :)

## 2. Leave "awkwardness" at the door:

Communication is still one of the most is underrated skills in software engineering. Probably due to the long-lasting cliche of programmers being "awkward and grumpy". 

As a developer, half of your job is to communicate what you do. You will participate in pair programming, grooming and planning sessions, demo meetings, and retrospectives. Both verbally and in writing.

It can be a piece of code, feature, or a team issue, including technical and non-technical stakeholders. Your success is tied directly to your ability to communicate.

Communicating technical solutions, measuring the pros and cons without losing your audience is hard. It means knowing how to disagree, how to receive feedback, and how to give feedback back. 

Communication is not a "soft" skill anymore; don't take it for granted.

**Pro tip**: use every opportunity you get to present and speak in public. Help writing stories, READMEs, documenting code, and technical decisions. And why not put some of those learnings in a blog article.

## 3. Work "with" rather than "besides."

The high degree of specialisation in software means most projects need a team to succeed. You succeed when your team succeeds. In software, lone-wolfs don't make it through the winter.

Your team will consist of diverse individuals with different goals and contexts. Focus on understanding other people's backgrounds, expectations, and communication styles. Adapt to them and integrate yourself into the team.

Ask yourself: how can I enable my team members? What do they expect from me? What are their goals?

Get to know your colleagues at a personal level. Something is exciting and unique about every individual. Find out what it is, be empathetic and geniue. 

There is no I in team. Give merit where is due. When things go wrong, take one for the team. You are not perfect, and you can't expect others to be so.

Teamwork is about trust, empathy, and alignment. Learn how individuals can enable each other, working "with" and not "besides" to deliver on a higher level.

**Pro tip**: change your mindset when it comes to teamwork. It is not about you anymore. I recommend "The 5 Dysfunctions of a team" and "Tribal Leadership".

## 4. Network: who knows about you.

Network means people that know about you and people that trust you. You worked so hard on improving your skills, and helping others. It would be a pity not to give visibility to all the hard work.

Developers are awkward, and "networking" in the traditional way is drowning. Yet, give it a shot. The best opportunities I've got came through my network. And not only that.

Advice on new technology, recommendations, life long mentors, and job opportunities all are easier to get through your network. Your network is your platform for change.

Start helping others out, and good things will happen.

You can also do that by trying to have lunch every week with someone you admire. In COVID-19 times, it is easier than ever as everyone is willing to help, and distance is no longer a barrier.

**Pro tip:** start creating connections now. Connect with like-minded developers that care about their professional image. Use Twitter, GitHub, Medium, LinkedIn. Get involved in the community and always give more than you take.

## 5. Balance: consistency over time

I've been struggling to find balance ever since starting, and I've burned out more than once.

It is easy to throw yourself at things, whether it is finishing a project or learning a new technology, or even writing an article. Yet, as stress accumulates, it will damage both your career and personal life.

Exercise, nutrition, and a well-deserved break from time to time will keep you going in the long run. Listen to your body and take a break from time to time. You are in for the long-game.

Pro tip: know thy self. Understand how you perform the best. Learn time management techniques. Create a weekly sports routine and stick to it.

### Closing up

Success in software is a mindset and a habit. Curiosity, continuous learning, and a passion for discovery are your fuel in such a fast-paced industry.
