Is JavaScript still a good career bet?

Hell, it is.

JS technologies were exotic five years ago.

Now they've been making their way in most organisations.

On top, companies that adopted them back then are now scaling projects.

They need javascript developers(you) more than ever.

So yes, still a fantastic bet.
