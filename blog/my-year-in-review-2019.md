## I switched jobs

After more than two years building a Software as Service solution, I decided to make a jump to the e-commerce space.  

I joined a company I really love and got the chance to work with people I respect and admire. I strongly believe that in terms of culture and people development we are one of the best employer in Berlin and will continue to be so in the years to come. 

For the last 4 years I was mainly focused on the startup scene. Wether it was Madrid or Berlin, I mainly worked for small high growth companies. I always tried to work in companies were I can be or stay close to the co-founders. I must admit I am in love with the underdogs. Nevertheless,  this year I gave a shot to more established employer. 

## I gave teaching a chance

I got a second job. As the Coding Bootcamp Teaching Assistant at one of Berlin's top universities I had the chance to share my passion and knowledge for software with a cohort of amazingly ambitious and driven individuals. I've met Benjamin, Tony, Roos and a big group of amazing students and programmers of tomorrow. One of the most rewarding experiences in my career. 

## I found a mentor and a friend

Mentorship is one of the best ways of advancing your career. Having somebody that already went through the journey sharing pieces of wisdom and advice is priceless. 

## I became a mentor

I became a mentor. Having people helping me on my way up has made me a strong believer in the power of mentorship. In September I signed up as mentor in the ReDI School of Digital Integration. My roles consists in mentoring people from all walks of life in their journey of securing a job in tech.
