Tech talent you attract with money will leave you for money.

Invest in a relationship beyond compensation.

That means investing in people.

It means investing in mentoring, development, and support.

Compensation is important, relationships are critical.

Treat employment as a partnership.

On average, your partner will surpass expectations.

And, when it comes to people.

Play to win :)
