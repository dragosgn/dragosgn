It sucks, right?

You pass the screening call.

Nail the technical interview.

And still get rejected?

Well, there are hundreds of factors that hiring managers care about.

Hiring is still human.

Still subjective.

Still luck.

My advice? Try again. 

Cliché, I know.

Even after you get that job, persisting will get you places. 

Be it production bugs,

unclear features and long deploys.

I am confident that you will make it.

You know why?

Because you persisted.

Stay cool,
