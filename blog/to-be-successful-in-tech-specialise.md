"Should I learn Python? Or do more Javascript?"

My advice, specialize.

Let me explain.

They hire you to solve one problem. Not 15.

Companies love specialists.

They get the job done. On time, on budget.

Pick your tool and stick with it.

With time you will become a "little Mozart". ðŸŽ¼

And "little Mozarts" never run out of jobs.





Stay cool,

Dragos
