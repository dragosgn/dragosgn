Hiring managers are not good or bad.\
\
They are busy.\
\
So, when you write that developer CV of yours.\
\
Make it shine. âœ¨\
\
Place your most relevant experience to the top.\
\
Add context.\
Add KPIs.\
Add frameworks and libraries.\
\
Link it to your GitHub.\
\
Give me a feeling of what kind of developer you are.\
\
Perfectionist, detailed thinker, always playing with the latest tech out there?\
\
Show it the best you can.\
\
And don't forget the buzzwords.\
\
LinkedIn never does.

<br />\
\
Stay cool,\
Dragos
