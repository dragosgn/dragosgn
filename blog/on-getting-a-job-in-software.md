The most frequent question I get these days.

How can I get a job in tech now? Hiring freezes are everywhere.

My one piece of advice to entry-level devs: code like hell.

Corona, or no corona.

Get your hands on as many projects as possible.

Show it on your Github, sell it on LinkedIn.

And that's about it.
