description: Don't let a silly storm mess with your boat.

\
I heard it twice last week.\
\
To deal with such moments and shedding tears:\
\
Think of a fixed point and a map.\
\
You are the fixed point.\
\
Everything you've achieved so far.\
\
All the little fights you had with the console.\
\
The map is your learning plan.\
\
Hold it close.\
\
In software, learning curves are steep.\
\
It is easy to slide away.\
\
So next time you feel like your boat is drifting.\
\
Think of these two.\
\
As any sailor,\
you will find your port.\
\
Don't let a silly storm mess with your boat.

\
Stay cool,\
Dragos
