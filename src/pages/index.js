      <h3>Hi, I am Dragos.</h3>
      <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
        I am a Software Engineer supporting a fantastic team at Mister Spex. On
        the side, I share my knowledge and passion for software by mentoring 20+
        incredible software developers on their journey.
      </p>
      <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
        Born in Romania, raised in Spain and now based in beautiful Berlin. This
        diversity of experiences, people, and perspectives marked my career. I
        hold a Bachelor in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Propulsion
        Systems.
      </p>
      <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
        Bankrupt before 23, when my software consulting company went burst, I
        went on and built a career in the industry. It meant moving(again) to a
        new country, sleeping on my friend's couch, and burning the midnight
        oil.
      </p>
      <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
        Since then, I've made my way up. After exploring Berlin's startup
        ecosystem, I ended up joining one of Europe's top tech companies -
        Mister Spex. Passionate about leadership, I perform best at the
        intersection between people, business, and technology.
      </p>
      <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
        It's been quite a ride, and I love every minute of it. As for the
        reader, work with people you admire and never settle.
      </p>
